# mobiSpringMVC
###DESCRIPTION:
####This is my first practise on the spring-framework.This project contains three parts:
###1.DataSource:
>mobiFile is gernerated by the spider based on SCRAPY.  
>   
>The website I crawled is www.kankindle.com You can find the spider named *The-mobi-spider*in my reposite.I will update it for more stronger.  

###2.Server-Side:
>Obviously,I use Spring-Framedwork.It has many functions:
>>1.you can search the mobi file.  
>2.you can send the mobi file to your kindle if you have added the *jasonXTU@163.com* to your email allow list in amazon.Or you can dowload the file directly.
>>3.The recommand system,you will find the mobi file sent by system in the home page.

###3.Web-side
>I use BootStrap,and the design is by myself.If you have some suggestion you can email me *lywhlao@163.com*
